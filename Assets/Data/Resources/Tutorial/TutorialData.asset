    subjectText: Writing process reminder
    messageText: 'Hey, you''re starting writing your next short story today, right?


      You''ve
      already got the plot, so all you have to do is writing the actual chapters.
      You told me there would be 3 of them. For each chapter you just have to follow
      the usual steps:

      1. plan

      2. write actions

      3. write dialogues


      Make
      sure to do proper research to avoid being stuck and write quality content.
      If in doubt, try to do something else than writing for a while, the important
      is to keep your motivation!'

      Make sure to keep
      hydrated, it has been pretty hot these days. And don''t push yourself too hard,
      get some rest when you need to.


      P.S.: did you remember to put the bin
      out?'

    subjectText: Deadline reached...
    messageText: Unfortunately you missed the deadline for releasing the book. I
      tried to convince the head of publishing to give you an extent, but they preferred
      cancelling the contract. Try harder next time...
